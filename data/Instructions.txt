Have your blue wire go from whatever pin is set in the code/script to a 240ohm resistor or if you dont have that have it go to
a 220ohm then have that go to a 22 ohm
resistor then have that go to the plus on the led and have the negative of the led go to ground
then do the same but for the red led.
